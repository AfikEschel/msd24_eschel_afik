# Good Style in Configuration Management

## Comments
- Use Javadoc (`/** ... */`) for all public methods and classes
- Explain purpose, not just what the code does
- No redundant or obvious comments

## Commits
- Use meaningful messages (present tense, active voice)
- Example: `Add factorial method to calculator`
- Group related changes into one commit
